## Install/Run instructions
This project was created in visual studio & visual studio code with blazor and is a blazor webassembly project. The following instructions are for use in Visual Studio; VSCode setup requires additional steps that are not covered here (You must use Visual Studio /VSCode to run this webapp, we did not include an executable file in our repository):
1. In visual studio, either clone the project directly from the github url using the built-in github clone option, or download and unpack the zip file and open the folder "CPSC481Project" in visual studio. 
2. Click the green "run" button in the top menu. The webapp should open automatically in a browser page

Within this menu is another dropdown to display advanced features likely to be used only by experienced users. Please note that not all of the filters have been implemented at this time. The filters that you can currently use are: Price min/max, no. of bed/bathrooms, property type (checkboxes), and year built (contained in the advanced filters dropdown). Once you have selected some filters, press the "search" button at the bottom of the dropdown to see results. Finally, the **explore all listings** button will show you all the listings in our database (please note that you may see some duplicate images of houses). After using one of these search tools, you will be taken to the search results page to see listings. The **saved** button in the top right will take you to the saved c
